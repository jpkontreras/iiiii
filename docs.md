# Menu System Documentation

## Menu Item Customization Guide

Our menu system offers a flexible way to personalize orders through two main customization options:

### 1. Item Styles (Variations)

- Represents different ways an item can be prepared
- Only one style can be selected per item
- May affect the final price
- Examples:
  - Drinks: Hot vs. Iced
  - Pizza: Regular Crust vs. Thin Crust
  - Sandwich: Toasted vs. Not Toasted

### 2. Item Customizations (Modifiers)

- Additional options to personalize your order
- Organized in logical groups (e.g., "Milk Options", "Extra Toppings")
- Multiple selections may be possible
- Each modifier may adjust the final price
- Examples:
  - Coffee Customizations:
    - Milk Options (choose one): Regular, Almond (+$0.50), Oat (+$0.50)
    - Extra Shots (optional): Up to 4 shots (+$0.75 each)
  - Pizza Customizations:
    - Extra Toppings (up to 5):
      - Extra Cheese (+$2.00)
      - Pepperoni (+$1.50)
      - Mushrooms (+$1.00)
